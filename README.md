# cyberbullying-detector

## About: Automatic cyberbullying detection challenge.
* Task 6-2: Type of harmfulness http://2019.poleval.pl/index.php/tasks/task6 through Machine learning methods
* Containerization and deployment



# Machine Learning Part

## data



The idea was to build
* build baseline model: tf-idf--> several ML algorithms
* build simple DL model: word2vec + simple CNN/lstm
* build SOTA model from XLnet

# Deployment Part
* Docker image (3.47GB in size)
* Deployed on Heroku: https://powerful-anchorage-24104.herokuapp.com
